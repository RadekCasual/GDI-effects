# GDI-effects
Here is a list of my GDI (graphical) effects/payloads that I created in a .NET Framework. You can use them in your project. I tried to describe the code so that it was understandable to everyone and indicate what values ​​can be changed, e.g. display time, color, etc.

# BEFORE YOU COPY ANY CODE FROM THIS REPOSITORY, OPEN VISUAL STUDIO, GO TO YOUR PROJECT OR CREATE A NEW ONE (PREFERABLY EMPTY PROJECT .NET FRAMEWORK) AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE FEATURES ENABLED IN REFERENCE MANAGER: System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms 
# YOU ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE OUTPUT TYPE FROM "Console Application" to "Windows Application" IN CLASS PREFERENCES!
