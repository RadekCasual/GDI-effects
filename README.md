# GDI-effects
Here is a list of my GDI (graphical) effects/payloads that I created in a .NET Framework. You can freely use them in your project.
I tried to describe the code so that it was understandable to everyone and indicate what values ​​can be changed, e.g. display time, color, etc.

# BEFORE YOU COPY ANY CODE FROM THIS REPOSITORY! 
Open visual studio, go to your project or create a new one (preferably empty project .NET Framework) and **make sure** you have the features enabled in **REFERENCE MANAGER**: `System.Drawing` and `System.Windows.Forms` 
You also have to **change output type** from "Console Application" to "Windows Application" in **CLASS PREFERENCES**!
